title: "Indentures of Trust and Restrictions"
---
The deed to your property will say something like “subject to indentures
and/or restrictions, if any”.  These are created to help the home owners
with their property values.

The Indentures of Trust and Restrictions, along with their amendments,
are recorded in Jefferson County at the Recorder of Deeds.

For your convenience, we have copies of the Indentures with their
amendments plus a transcription of the Indentures with the amendments
made.  Although we have tried hard to make these complete and accurate,
they are ***NOT*** the offical documents; please refer to the officially
recorded documents.
