Antire Valley Subdivision Meeting\
Meeting was called to order by Scott Nelson

Financial Report:

- main account has $137,024.80
- road fund has $46,664.80
- well construction fund is $168,951.62
- well operating fund is $4,524.19

The Central bank loan for the alleys has a balance of $4,884.80\
The Royal bank loan for the well has a balance of $86,612.26

Hopefully when the alley loan is paid off, the trustees can lower the assessment.
Unpaid assessments total $33,209.35.  A letter has been sent informing those who
owe how much and that liens are applied to delinquent loans. Also they can be
sued and have to pay court costs
in addition to their outstanding balance.

City and Village has new software which will allow residents to pay on line and
in any amount. Information about that was mailed with the water report.

The May financial reports just came. Brian Urban offered to learn how to post them.

Rich Peterson (1401 Horseshoe Bend) has a metal detector borrowed from the library
for the next three weeks if anyone wants to use it to find their water cutoff in
the front yard.

Nick Kuntz has the shut off tool that turns the water cutoff underground.

It was asked who is responsible for the water lines. Nick responded that the
subdivision has accepted responsibility of the water lines to the foundation
of homes; it is the homeowner’s responsibility from the foundation and in the
house.

Well report by Nick Kuntz: Flynn will hook up the plumbing on the new tank sometime
in the next five weeks. The process includes adding valves, new pipes, a “doghouse”
around the pipes where they are above ground so they won’t freeze, filling and
bleaching the new tank. Then the old tank will be demolished on site and taken away.
The wall on the well house that is currently the old tank will need to be rebuilt
and a new roof installed.

The water will probably only be out for 2-3 hours when the
well switchover is done.

Remember not to put flushable wipes in the toilet. They caused a serious clog recently.

When we have a power failure, the system does not restart automatically. Nick has to
get up in the middle of the night and make that happen. Thank you, Nick! He has
three years left on his certification and does not want to renew it when it expires.
The outside substitute has only six months longer than Nick’s certification and he
doesn’t plan to renew. We need some new, younger people from the neighborhood to get
certified. Nick will gladly train, there is funding from the state to pay for the courses
you have to take and we legally have to have such a person in place. Non-certified
people cannot care for the well.\
We have the simplest water system. If we automate it, someone has to be there 24/7.

We used 18% less water this year so the sewer bills went down but only 5%.

Scott Nelson’s three year term ends today. Thank you, Scott, for all your hard work. Brian Urban has another year in filling out Ben Schmidt’s term. Nick was elected as a replacement for Scott. The trustees will appoint someone to fill in for Sharon Mullinex who has resigned.

Those who have seen it like Scott’s creation of AntireValley.org. The indentures and amendments are posted there. The trustees would like to put more documents out there. If or when Scott has more time, he might make some more enhancements.

The trustees should check out liability insurance coverage since it hasn’t been changed in years.

A motion was made and seconded to close the meeting.

Respectfully submitted, Cathy Nelson
