## Water System Update

Although the water pressure has returned to normal, **the boil order is still
in effect**.  Please boil for three minutes any water that you might ingest.

Please check antirevalley.org for any updates.

Below is the original boil order message for your convenience.

Residents in Antire Valley Subdivision

Effective July 10, 2025

Due to the well running dry, causing low water pressure in our water
system, the trustees have issued a boil order until further notice.

## What you should do

Boil all water vigorously for at least three minutes before drinking,
cooking, brushing teeth, making ice, or any other activity where the
water might be ingested.

Do not consume ice from automatic ice makers. Dispose of existing ice
and remake with boiled and cooled water.

Wash dishes and food contact surfaces by immersing them for at least
one minute in clean tap water containing one teaspoon of unscented
bleach per gallon of water, or use a dishwasher with a sanitizing
cycle.

Water used for bathing generally does not need to be boiled, but
supervise children and individuals with open wounds or weakened immune
systems to avoid accidental ingestion.

## When the advisory will be lifted

The water system will be stabilized, and bacteriological samples will
be collected to ensure the water is again safe for consumption. A
separate notice will be issued when the boil water order has been
lifted.

For more information contact one of the trustees.
Cooperation and patience during this time are appreciated.
