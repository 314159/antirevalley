<h2 id="water-well">Water Well</h2>
<p>As you all can see the well project is coming to an end. It must be said this
project could not have been accomplished without the hard work of past
and present trustees, their hard work has saved us a lot of money “thank
you”. The cost came in around the $313,000 range.</p>
<h2 id="subdivision-insurance">Subdivision Insurance</h2>
<p>Tim has taken on the task of bringing the subdivision insurance up to date,
this cost will be more expensive.</p>
<h2 id="subdivision-future-and-trustees">Subdivision future and trustees</h2>
<p>Tim and Nick have been serving this subdivision, on and off, 30 plus years.
The time has come to recruit a couple of our younger residents to pick up
their torch and carry it forward. Running this subdivision is easy now that
the well is complete. <strong>City and Village</strong> pays all bills and all the administration
duties. By law, we need three trustees to run this subdivision and if we do
not recruit other trustees this community will be forced to pay for outside
help.</p>
<p>We have some very smart younger residents, more kids too. My call to
action is to ask for volunteers to step up and carry the Antire Valley torch
into the future, it’s not that difficult.</p>
<h2 id="delinquent-hoa-payments">Delinquent HOA payments</h2>
<p>We have hired an attorney firm to collect past due payments. To all that fall
into this category remember this community is the best deal in town, your
HOA includes water!!!</p>
<h2 id="party">Party</h2>
<p>I would like to see if we can start a yearly block party. Our older residents
organized these parties in the past, we can do it again.</p>
