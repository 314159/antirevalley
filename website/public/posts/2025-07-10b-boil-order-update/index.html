<p>Although the water pressure has returned to normal, <strong>the boil order is still
in effect</strong>.  Please boil for three minutes any water that you might ingest.</p>
<p>Please check antirevalley.org for any updates.</p>
<p>Below is the original boil order message for your convenience.</p>
<p>Residents in Antire Valley Subdivision</p>
<p>Effective July 10, 2025</p>
<p>Due to the well running dry, causing low water pressure in our water
system, the trustees have issued a boil order until further notice.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-do">What you should do</h2>
<p>Boil all water vigorously for at least three minutes before drinking,
cooking, brushing teeth, making ice, or any other activity where the
water might be ingested.</p>
<p>Do not consume ice from automatic ice makers. Dispose of existing ice
and remake with boiled and cooled water.</p>
<p>Wash dishes and food contact surfaces by immersing them for at least
one minute in clean tap water containing one teaspoon of unscented
bleach per gallon of water, or use a dishwasher with a sanitizing
cycle.</p>
<p>Water used for bathing generally does not need to be boiled, but
supervise children and individuals with open wounds or weakened immune
systems to avoid accidental ingestion.</p>
<h2 id="when-the-advisory-will-be-lifted">When the advisory will be lifted</h2>
<p>The water system will be stabilized, and bacteriological samples will
be collected to ensure the water is again safe for consumption. A
separate notice will be issued when the boil water order has been
lifted.</p>
<p>For more information contact one of the trustees.
Cooperation and patience during this time are appreciated.</p><ul class="pa0">
