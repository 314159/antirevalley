      <description>From Bryan Urban:
Water Well As you all can see the well project is coming to an end. It must be said this project could not have been accomplished without the hard work of past and present trustees, their hard work has saved us a lot of money “thank you”. The cost came in around the $313,000 range.
Subdivision Insurance Tim has taken on the task of bringing the subdivision insurance up to date, this cost will be more expensive.</description>
