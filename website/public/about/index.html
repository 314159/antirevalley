        <p>The subdivision is a group of 80 homes nestled in the hills between Fenton and Eureka. It gives the
peace of the country while still being within fifteen minutes of the St. Louis City limits.</p>
<p>The homes are not large, making for good starter houses, but most of us like it so much we have
stayed far longer. Our alleys, although typically a city feature, make safe places for children to
play. That also creates back entrance garages, an attractive feature. We enjoy the lower rates of
Jefferson County taxes. By and large it is a friendly neighborhood, mostly lived in by owners but
with some rentals.</p>
<p>We have our own well so no water charges. We have a three member board of trustees that lead the
home owners association. There is a common ground where residents can have activities. In the fall
the hills around us are bursts of beautiful colors and we are glad that we live in such a great
location.</p>
